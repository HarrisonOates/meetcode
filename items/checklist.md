# Group Assignment Checklist
The following markdown document is a checklist of items you **should** complete before submission of your assignment. This exists to help you keep track of all the requirements you must fulfil.

## Git & Project Access
- [X] **GitLab**: Commits (as shown in the Git commit history) using your own account. Failing to do this may result in zero marks.
- [X] **GitLab**: Have the relevant marking tutors as 'maintainers' for your repository.
- [X] The markers will be able to login to your **App** via the APK using either of the 2 sets of accounts in the assignment specification.
